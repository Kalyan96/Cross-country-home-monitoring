### Summary:

This project is a comprehensive, state-of-the-art implementation of a **multi-threaded video monitoring system with motion detection and PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) camera control**. It showcases a fusion of advanced Python programming, ONVIF protocol usage, real-time video processing, and multi-threading for high-performance applications. Below is a breakdown of the system's functionality and highlights:

---

### **Core Features:**
1. **ONVIF Camera Initialization and Configuration:**
   - Leveraging the ONVIF protocol, the application communicates with network cameras for video streaming and PTZ control.
   - Dynamic fetching of RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) URLs ensures adaptability across various camera configurations.

2. **Real-Time Video Streaming:**
   - Uses OpenCV for capturing and processing video frames.
   - Incorporates GPU support (if available) to enhance video frame processing efficiency.
   - Implements robust handling of video stream interruptions with automatic reconnections.

3. **Motion Detection with Contour Analysis:**
   - Background subtraction and morphological transformations for noise reduction.
   - Real-time contour analysis to detect significant motion.
   - Saves snapshots during motion events with timestamps for future reference.

4. **PTZ Control and Camera Movement:**
   - Intuitive PTZ controls to adjust camera orientation dynamically based on detected motion or user input.
   - Fine-tuned continuous and absolute movement with pan, tilt, and zoom adjustment.

5. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - Developed using Tkinter for user interaction.
   - Enables manual camera control via keyboard inputs and live video feed display.
   - Displays real-time PTZ position updates.

6. **Resilient Stream Monitoring and Recovery:**
   - Multi-threaded architecture ensures uninterrupted video processing.
   - Monitors stream health, performs diagnostics, and executes auto-reconnection mechanisms when needed.

7. **ESP32 Camera Integration:**
   - Includes reset and initialization routines for IoT-based camera systems like ESP32.
   - Supports serial communication to reset and restore video capture functionality.
