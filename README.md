### **Core Features with Tunnel Protocol Integration:**
1. **Secure Video Transmission:**
   - Utilizes **tunnel protocols** (e.g., **SSH Tunneling** or **VPN**) to create an encrypted channel between the monitoring system and remote cameras.
   - Ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data streams, preventing unauthorized access or interception during cross-border communication.

2. **Remote Accessibility Over Public Networks:**
   - By leveraging tunneling technologies, the system bypasses NAT (Network Address Translation) restrictions and firewalls, enabling seamless access to remote cameras.
   - Configures **port forwarding** securely through tunnels to facilitate uninterrupted video streaming and PTZ commands.

3. **Low-Latency Communication:**
   - Optimized tunnel configurations ensure minimal latency, providing a real-time experience even when monitoring cameras across continents.
   - Proactively monitors connection stability and adjusts settings dynamically to maintain performance.

4. **Redundancy and Reliability:**
   - Combines tunnel protocols with periodic network diagnostics (e.g., ping-based checks) to ensure continuous operation.
   - Automatically re-establishes tunnels if a connection is dropped, minimizing downtime in critical monitoring scenarios.

5. **End-to-End Security:**
   - Protects sensitive credentials and data streams using industry-standard encryption (e.g., AES for VPN or RSA for SSH).
   - Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures only authorized users can access the system.

### **Technical Highlights:**
- **On-the-Fly RTSP Streaming Over Tunnels:**
   - Securely retrieves RTSP streams from remote ONVIF-compliant cameras over encrypted tunnels.
   - Maintains video quality while ensuring data security.

- **Dynamic PTZ Commands via Tunnel:**
   - Real-time PTZ control commands (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) are securely transmitted through the tunnel, ensuring precise camera adjustments without compromising security.

- **Motion Detection with Centralized Storage:**
   - Combines motion detection with encrypted storage solutions for secure archival of detected events.

- **IoT Integration with ESP32:**
   - Configures IoT devices to use secure tunnels, extending the monitoring capabilities to include lightweight, cost-effective hardware.
